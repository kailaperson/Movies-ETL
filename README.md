# Movies-ETL
## Overview of the analysis 
- The purpose of the analysis is to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files, Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data, and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
